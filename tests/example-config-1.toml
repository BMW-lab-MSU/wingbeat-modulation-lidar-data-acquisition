# This configuration file somewhat follows the INI configuration used by the Gage
# SDK examples. We remove some configuration options that aren't needed or
# possible, and we change some settings. The Gage SDK has three separate
# configuration sections that can be set: acquisition, channel, and trigger; thus
# we use those sections in this config, even though the INI files from the SDK
# examples use slightly different sections. For instance, we don't support an
# [Application] section like the official INI examples do, as there is no need.

[trigger]
# Trigger on rising edge. Supported values are:
# Rising edge: "rising","r","positive","p",1
# Falling edge: "falling","f","negative","n",0
condition = "rising"

# Set trigger level to 50%
level = 50

# External trigger input range isn't supported on the CSE161G2 model

# Default options that should not be changed for the insect lidar since we
# have to use the external trigger
# Supported values: "external", 1 (for channel 1), 2 (for channel 2)
source = "External" 


[acquisition]
# For supported sample rates, see the Gage RazorMax Express datasheet.
# We are using the CSE161G2 model, which has a max sample rate of 1 GS/s.
sample_rate = 1e9 # 1 GS/s

# The number of samples to acquire per pulse / trigger event.
# This might as well always be a power of 2, as that should be more efficient
# for the hardware (I'm not convinced that the SDK really supports arbitrary
# sample depths, anyway).
# We have no reason to acquire pre-trigger data, thus n_samples covers
# both the "Depth" and "SegmentSize" options in the official INI config. Setting
# these to the same value results in no pre-trigger data being captured.
n_samples = 32768 

# Trigger delay can be used to delay data acquisition by a number of samples
# after the trigger event. This might be useful if the first handful of samples
# occur before the light has even left the instrument
trigger_delay = 0

# The number of sequential pulses to acquire. Values greater than 1 result in a
# "multiple record acquisition", as it's referred to in the Gage documentation.
# This parameter corresponds to the "SegmentCount" config option in the official
# INI files
segment_count = 32

[channel]
# We only support single channel acquisition, but we can set which channel
# we want to use
channel = 1

# Voltage range of the input channel, in mV. The ADC's full input range is +/- 1 V,
# so we use the full range, which is 2000 mV.
range = 2000

# The DC offset is programmable and can span the full scale input range.
# TODO: determine if there having a DC offset is useful; if the PMT truly can't
# output positive current/voltage values, then we could add a -1000 mV offset to
# make then input range -2 V to 0 V
dc_offset = 0

# The input channels have 50 Ohm input impedance, and are DC-coupled. Since
# these options are not software-selectable, we don't support those options,
# even though the Gage SDK supports them.
